# Rn Data analysis and visualization

In this repository you can find the RAW Rn data and the codes, written in `Python` pogramming language (.ipynb), that where used to analyse the data and visualize it.

## Data distrbution code (Data distribution.ipynb)

This Jupyter notebook reads the RAW data and create graphs for easier visualization and comparison with recommended levels and previous measurements in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region.

## Multivariate analysis code (Multivariate analysis.ipynb)

This Jupyter notebbok uses the information of the RAW RC data (Dependent variable) and the independent variables to fit one log-linear regression model.

Subsequently, this notebook uses the data of Bogot√°'s cadastre to apply the regression model on all the houses with information of the independent variables. These results were mapped later using `ArcGIS`.
